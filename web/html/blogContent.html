<h3>Homework 1: Web Proposal</h3>
<p>
    I did a proposal for a website based on my interest in game and novel writing. 
    The proposal contain a list of the basic feature for the website. 
    Very confuse between homework and lab but I luckily submit it on time (just to realized it won't be graded)

<h3>Homework 2: Database</h3>
<p>
    I populate the 2 databases, in which one is mine and the other is for grading. 
    I have a bit of problem with the foreign key and inserting data into my database but overall the process isn't hard. 
    Still have trouble with lab and homework submission.

<h3>Homework 3: JSP Home Page</h3>
<p>
    I was a bit confuse with the homework and lab and result in not turning the project on time. 
    However, on the bright side, I have tried to make the webpage as beautiful as possible with self design logo and self drawn image. 
    I also spent a lot of time working on the left nav bar and the overall design of the page. 
    (which is not what I suppose to do in the first place) With all the sidetrack aside, 
    I have dissected the code carefully and was success in replicate the source code into my own version.

 <h3>Homework 4: Display Data</h3>
 <p>Data Model</p>
 <p>
     The data model contain 4 table, 1 user table, 1 other table, 1 associative table and 1 user role table.
 My web data model is based on an online game website data model so the user table will be replaced with mmo_player table,
 the other table becomes game_class, associative table becomes your_character table and user role become user_role.
 The model is based on a many to many relationship between mmo_player table and game_class table and a
 one to one relationship between mmo_player table and user_role able. The premiere of the database is that one player can hold
 many game class and one game class can be played by many player. The user will also have a role assigned to them in the context of operating the game.
 The mmo_player tale holds information about the players and the game_class table holds the information about fantasy class that the player can choose from.
 The your_character table is the connection between the mmo_player and the game_class and hold the record for each player's game_class record.
 The user_role table hold information about role of player ranging from player to admin

            I still manage to screw up the homework and the lab, but this time I think I get the hang of it.
            Besides that, I manage to run the source code and reuse the code to make some alteration and add 2 more packages and 2 more API page. 
            I didn't understand what the dropdownMenu.html was for until I open it individually and found that it was a big help. 
            I have quite some trouble adjusting the drop down menu until I found out about !important. 
            Connecting with database caused me some vexation a few first time before I learned that the error system is really helpful.

 <h3>Homework 5: Log on</h3>
 <p>
     for this assignment, I make some alteration to the lab to create a log on function that can be access through 
     the search option in the web page. I had no problem with the lab but I do have problems that I couldn't fix until the next lab. 
     The problem lies mostly on the the log on jsp and jx files as the getParameter() seems to be stranger than I thought. 
 </p>

<h3>Homework 6: Insert</h3>
 <p>
     for this assignment, I alter the code for the complex insert function for the "user table" and create some other insert
     function for "other table" and "associate table". It was fairy easy with the other and associate table but I got some problem with the user table since 
     I got some problem with PickUser Role part. The problem was that my user role was in String datatype but the given code data type is Int. 
     I fix the problem by altering my own database to match the given data type. Quite a cheap move but due to the time constrain I have no other choice.
 </p>
 
 <h3>Homework 7: Delete</h3>
 <p>
     for this assignment, I alter the code for the delete function and add additional delete function for other and associative table.
     for some reason, this time I forgot to submit the homework this time. Life is such a roller coaster. Nothing is too difficult about the 
     work this week besides from my late tendency.
 </p>
 
  <h3>Homework 8: Update</h3>
 <p>
     for this assignment, I add a CRUD that combine all insert, delete and update into one javascript files.
     the assignment was rather simple. I also add additional picklist for the insert and update function of the associative table. 
     I also found out that I have to do my final test today as well. Wish me luck.
