The title is short for Symphony At Dawn (I know, I'm a genius)  
A (almost) gaming sites that provide information and immerse gameplay experience. Or at least that's what it is intended to be.
I created this with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS for Web Dev course at Temple University

## Motivation
Two Steps From Hell(TSFH) is an American based music producing company that innovate the genre of epic music. I was extremely insipred by theme to the point that I created my own lore, digital painting and writing around the songs(which is mostly instrumental and free to intepret). This website is kinda like a showcase of the product I created as a fan of TSFH.

## Getting Started
These instructions will guild you through the inital setting up process and 
highlight what the apps can do for you to explore on your own.
