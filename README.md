A (almost) gaming sites that provide information and immerse gameplay experience. Or at least that's what it is intended to be.
I created this with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS for Web Dev course at Temple University


### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  
In case you would like to make this project your own, you need your own MySQL database and got it hooked to the JDBC manager.


### Notable feature
- Single Page Application with HTML injected content
- Self created APIs using JSP technologies
- CRUD functionalities, log on/off, filter, etc...
- SQL injection prevention with preparedStatement
- AJAX
- REST
- Many reusable JS components like slideshow.


### Sections
- Navigation bar
- Lef Navigation bar
- CRUD
- Account
- Home
- Blog
- Game content (coming soon)


### Prequesite
a server like [Glassfish](https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/) or [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/),   
or [VsCode live server plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)  
[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) if you want to host your own data


### Recommendation
[Netbean Glassfish/Tomcat support bundle](https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/rc/)


### Installing and Running
Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/zahego/Buggit.git
```
run the file on server, or if run on Netbean with web support bundle, just click 'Run'  
explore the functionalities  


### What you can do
- try insert, delete and update some data  
- check out some information on the weapons page, I came up with all those data myself
