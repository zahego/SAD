<p  align=center style='text-align:center'><u><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Chap 0: After the fall</span></u></p>

<p >In the azure, clear sky, there fell an angel.<b> </b>Surrounding
him was red hellish ash escaping the fury heat of the fire that was consuming
his immortal flesh. His face flame d red while the fire on his wings was brightened
with mahogany. His heart was even more blazed, a black inferno of hatred. A
false decision led his father, the Almighty God of heaven, imbued all the sins
of human into his core and let him fall as the grotesque of humankind heatedly
engulfed him.</p>

<p >After a long fall, he reached the ground with force. The
impact shattered all his bones and left the ground with a big hollow. All
vegetations and animals around him were quickly eradicated by the radiation. He
mustered his last strength to look around with blood red tears running down his
cheek and then collapsed into unconsciousness, with belligerence and agony took
over his hope. The spark once suffocated his lung as well as his souls soon
subdued, leaving his withered flesh wrapped inside the over-burnt skin rested
and reflected upon his action.</p>

<p >As the man opened his eyes
again, his head and torso started to feel more comfortable as if he was laid on
something soft but dusty. He tried to move his limbs but couldn't since his
bones haven't properly healed, and the many layers of fabric girded around his
arms and legs have put too much weight on him. In fact, all his body was
covered with rigid white roller bandage. [new]He tilted his head up to look
around. It was a simple house with old wooden walls and handcraft furniture to
keep the place less cold and lonely. There were a few cracks and holes here and
there, but this helped to bring in the mild sweet fragrant of the flowers and
hay outside the house. He put his head down again, trying to process all the
information he just obtained from all of his reviving senses. <span
style='color:red'>As </span>he was pondering, he heard footsteps coming toward
him. Gathered more strength toward his neck, he turned his head toward the
direction of the coming sounds. Appeared before him was a young girl at her
late teenage year. She was carrying a bucket of white liquid. After she put the
bucket on the table, she seemed to notice he was staring at her and came to his
bed. Before she reached the bed, she touched a few other furniture to guide her
way toward him.</p>

<p >As she sat in a chair next to him, she started talking with
a loud and excited tone:</p>

<p>-"You are finally awake. Isabel thought you would not
recover after such injuries, but I knew you would."</p>

<p >He noticed her blue oval iris sparkled as she spoke. The
girl proceeded to lift his left arm up from the elbow and then his left leg
from the knee. She squinted her eyes for a closer look at his face and exclaimed
in surprised:</p>

<p >-"Half of your bones were back to normal. Back when I found
you lying on the ground, you are just a mushy boneless slime."</p>

<p >As the girl was examining, another feminine voice from
outside called in:</p>

<p >-"Hey Eri, have you finished milking the cow?"</p>

<p >The girl stood up and screamed back, her voice was fill with
hastiness yet jolly:</p>

<p >-"Just a sec, Isabel. I'm coming!"</p>

<p >The girl finished her check up quickly and said to the man:</p>

<p >-"I must continue my work now. At this rate, you will be
running in no time. Don't worry!"</p>

<p >As she walked to the door, another girl with honey blonde
hair appeared at the front door. Both girls seemed to be around the same age. </p>

<p >-"What took you so long, Eri?"</p>

<p >-"Remember the person I brought back the other night? He's
recovering! Fast as well!!"</p>

<p >-"...Impossible! That man was only a pulp that night!"</p>

<p >-"I know, right? Isn't that a miracle!!?"</p>

<p >-"Indee...Hey, are you trying to avert to another subject!?"</p>

<p >-"Aw, right, I forget! Milking cows, right? I'm onto it!"</p>

<p >Eri quickly disappear from the door with another empty
bucket. Her whistle was loud enough that one can still hear it even inside the
house after she was long gone. The other girl, Isabel, seemed to be still at
the door. She walked toward the bed and looked at the man in disbelief for a
while.</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Eri was right! You are already healed! Well, mostly!"</p>

<p >She sat next to him and look at him some more. She also had
dazzling cerulean eyes like those of Eri, but in those beautiful irises, the
man sensed vast distressed hidden deep inside. </p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Eri has always been a good but unfortunate girl, and to think that she
finds such join by nursing someone..."</p>

<p >Isabel mumbled silently as she stood up while still looked
at him.</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Thank you..."</p>

<p >The girl's voice became quieter as she left the house.
Moving his head and making his senses work again started to make the man feel
tired. He lay down again and closed his eyes, hoping to get a good sleep. The
traumatic experience he just endured not long ago started emerged again, and it
took a while for him to finally settle into a nightmarish sleep. </p>

<p >He opened his eyes again when the cocks haven't crowed. The
breezy fog of the night covered the house, making the road outside even darker
and more blurred. His upper half seemed to be more responsive as he could sit
with his back straight without feeling too much pressure in his spine. He
looked around the house again. Same furniture, same wooden wall but the
darkness around them added one more level of dangerous to the overall scenery.
The only reassuring source around is a dim yellow light emitted weakly from a
half-melted candle on the table. A small wind could easily end the appearance
of the fire, leaving everything left in hand of the cruel night. The man
reached his hand out toward the candle direction, channeled his inner energy
and released it as an invisible force. The candle burst out a bigger flame in a
second and then reduced into a more stable and indomitable light. He looked at
his hand with a reassuring glance and then kept looking around until his eyes
reached Eri, who was sleeping beside him on the same bed.</p>

<p >In contrast of her morning energetic natural, Eri looked
more peaceful and a slightly uneasy when she slept. She must have worried about
something, but her personalities prevent those negative feeling from leaking
and even made her unaware that there was doubt in her heart. The man gently put
his hand on her cheek, which was embellished with a slight pink color from the
cold night. He did not know her before, but he knew the girl would relieve her
burden as soon as she woke up in the morning. The man did not believe in fate
anymore, but he believed there was no coincident that he encountered this girl
in the beginning of his new journey. </p>

<p >He reached out to her and caress around the contour of her
cheek. He stopped at her soft, thin hair and slowly twirl a strand around his
rough fingers. Although not easily visible, Eri expressed a sense of slight
disturbance as she knitted her thin raisin-color eyebrows while faintly pouting
her full lips. The man was amused, as he twirled another Eri's hair strand
while kept observing Eri's change of facial expression. He soon stopped before
he might go overboard and looked at Eri's face returning to a serene state. He
continued his observation of her as his tiredness slowly faded away with the
onyx shade of the night.  </p>

<p >When Eri woke up in the morning, the man was not in the bed
anymore. She jumped off her bed; the quick motion in the morning without any
proper stretch made her almost fall headfirst. She started flipping every object
around her house to search for him. She then ran outside hurriedly but there
was still no sight of him. Her mind started working faster and she ran
frantically to the place she found him. As she passed through the road to get
to the site, she saw him sitting there looking at a tall tree. On his hand
landed a tiny yellow bird, chirping joyful morning sounds. He noticed her
appearance and slowly stood up. She was going to mutter something but running
around has taken all her strength, leaving her gasping heavily and couldn't
think straight. Her hand was tightly grapping on the nearest tree trunk and her
left knee in search for support since her legs has given out. He seemed to
understand what she was trying to accomplish and walked toward her. He picked
up her right frail arm and wrapped it around his shoulder. They walked back to
Eri's house and he put Eri on a chair. Eri was so puzzled by the recovery and
the quirkiness of her quiet patient that she did not realize that the empty hole
that she found him was now a blooming forest again. </p>

<p >Back at Eri's house, the man fixed her a quick but
nutritious breakfast since she was too tired to do anything. After a good meal,
Eri's spirit was back to normal and before she started to say anything,
Isabel's footsteps and voice could already be heard:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Hey Eri, what took you so long? it's time to wor..."</p>

<p >She stopped in shocked at the front door as she saw the man
was sitting at the table with Eri.</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Ho...how did...?"</p>

<p >Seeing the presence of Isabel, Eri's eyes shone again as she
told Isabel what happened earlier. </p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"I cannot believe this!"-Isabel exclaimed and looked at the man-"Ho... how
is this happened?"</p>

<p >The man shook his head.</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Who are you? Do you remember who you are? Can you talk?"</p>

<p >The man paused and continued to shake his head.</p>

<p >-"Guess you voice still hasn't recove...."</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"What's your name?"</p>

<p >Didn't let Isabel finish her monologue, Eri's naively stroke
in another question. Her unusual eyes were as animated as ever.</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Eri, I don't think he can talk ye...."</p>

<p >Just as Isabel tried to finish her sentence, the man's dried
lips moved. </p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"I think he's telling us something..."</p>

<p >Eri said. </p>

<p >The man started forming sounds. His first attempted was a
long and dull "u" which inevitably brought the two girls closer to hear him properly.
He tried again, this time, the words were still cacophonous and low pitch, but
they know exactly what he was saying:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"...Lu...</p>

<p >...ci...</p>

<p >...fer..."</p>

<p >After hearing the name, Isabel looked at the man with even
more terrified eyes. She shakenly mumbled in deference:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Lucifer...I should have known better..."</p>

<p >Knowing her friend wouldn't understand the gravity of the
situation, Isabel quickly grabbed Eri's hand and explained to her:</p>

<p >- "Do you remember the stories in the bible I often read to
you from when we were kids till now?"</p>

<p >-"Well, yeah.."-Eri said as her eyes rolled away to not look
directly at her friend.</p>

<p >-"Do you remember Lucifer??"</p>

<p >-"Is he in the bible?"-Eri asked, attempting to sound as if
she still remembered something at all.</p>

<p >-"Yes! He's one of the archangel..."</p>

<p >-"Aren't the angels supposed to have wings and halo and live
in the sky?"</p>

<p >-"Yes, but you have seen his capability to do amazing feast,
I'm pretty sure that..."</p>

<p >-"You are just overthinking! I heard the monk in the north
can even survive without food for a month! I would already death within three
days of not having anything to eat."</p>

<p >-"But he could still be..."</p>

<p >-"Now now, Isabel, I know it would be hard to persuade you
by myself, so let ask him directly."</p>

<p >Eri then turned to the man and asked:</p>

<p >-:Hey Lucifer, are you able to perform any kind of magic?"</p>

<p >The man shook his head.</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Do you have wings and live in the sky?"</p>

<p >The man looked to his shoulder, which doesn't show any sign
of extra body parts and look back.</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Are you an angel?"</p>

<p >The man shook his head again.</p>

<p >-"See?"</p>

<p >-"But..."</p>

<p >As Isabel denied in vain, another man of middle age walked
in. He put his hand over Isabel's bright silky hair and said rambunctious with
a low-pitch voice:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Now ladies, are you gonna do your work or let this old man do it by
himself?"</p>

<p >Eri turned back exuberantly and jumped to hug the old man:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Uncle Huddle! You are back!"</p>

<p >The old man received Eri's hug with joy and loud laughter. Isabel
did not seem to be approved of the man appearance. She asked, worriedly.</p>

<p >-"You are still sick, dad! Why are you out here?"</p>

<p >-"I feel great today! Don't worry! I think it's time I join
the harvest with you girls."</p>

<p >The man replied. </p>

<p >-"Don't be fooling yourself, the doctor said your illness
would took several more months before you are better. Now listen to me and go
back to bed."</p>

<p >-"Nonsense! I don't trust those ruly healers. How can I let
two beautiful ladies here do all the man's work?"</p>

<p >-"Aww! thanks, Uncle Huddle!"</p>

<p >Eri quickly jumped in with her satirical gratitude. They
laugh loudly but Isabel did not shared their humor.</p>

<p >-"I'm serious, dad. No more work until you rest properly."</p>

<p >-"Don't worry, I... uh....*cough* *cough*</p>

<p >As soon as Isabel's father was about to deny his condition,
he started coughing profoundly. Isabel and Eri quickly grabbed his arms before
he could collapse into the ground.</p>

<p >-"I think Isabel is right! You should rest, Uncle Huddle!"</p>

<p >Eri looked at him with the same face as Isabel's a few
minutes ago. The man was not fully convinced and stubbornly brought out
excuses.</p>

<p >-"...I don't think you girls can finish the work anytime soon,
especially with Eri's condition.... Anyway, I am the head of this farm! I should
take more responsible for my work instead of you..."</p>

<p >-"...But you will have a stroke again, dad."</p>

<p >As Isabel tried to reason with her father, Eri looked around
to find something to support her friend's decision. Her eyes stopped at where Lucifer
was still sitting silently.</p>

<p >-"I know what if we have someone else to help?"</p>

<p >Isabel and her father stopped and looked at Eri with unfathomable
dilemmatic eyes. Knowing she had made a bad move, Eri still decided to roll
with it and pull Lucifer from his chair to near where the three were standing. </p>

<p >-"What if we ask Lucifer to help?"</p>

<p >Lucifer was extremely shocked. He had been the right hand of
god for as long as the universe was created. Never have him been asked to do
even the easiest chores in Heaven by anyone higher than him, now a mere mortal
was about to ask him to perform such horrendous work. Although he had acknowledged
about Eri's careless nature, he hasn't prepared to be treated by an underling
as its equal.</p>

<p >As Lucifer shook his head furiously in despair, Isabel also
raised her concern.</p>

<p >-"Eri! We don't know anything about Lucifer yet! We can't
ask him to do our work."</p>

<p >Lucifer nodded his head in total agree. It has been so long
since anyone said something remotely correct around him. Eri, with her extreme
unawareness of the situation, still pressed onto Lucifer.</p>

<p >-"...But Isabel, he was strong enough to carry me till we get
home. And I think Lucifer would love to help, am I right, Lucifer?"</p>

<p >Lucifer was blasted from one astonishment to another. He
continuously moved his head and hands from one side to another to express
strong denial. His sweat started pouring out like rainfall, soaking the bandage
to the point it almost felt off. He came to develop a feeling he has never
encountered before in his entire existence from this girl, fear. </p>

<p >Looking at Lucifer, Isabel's father also questioned his
validity for the job.</p>

<p >-"I don't know about him carrying you home, but isn't he
just about to die a few days ago? I would not let an injured person do the hard
work in my property. That's just not my style!"</p>

<p >Again, Lucifer nodded his head in full agreement. He thought
that Eri would soon give up after such an on-point reason, but the situation
didn't go according to his rational thinking. </p>

<p >A few hours later, Lucifer caught himself bending his back
tending the potatoes. The brown color of the potatoes, faded by fog and
droplets of water, blended together with the yellowish ivory white sunlight
keep Lucifer wondering why he even complied to do such unfit work for a being
born with such high and might. He could have just easily use his magic to make
Eri gave up her bizarre idea or make the potatoes harvest themselves, but he
decided to deal with his task physically. Lucifer thought he used to know
himself extremely well, but now he couldn't be so certain anymore.</p>

<p >Isabel after getting her father to finally give up his
stubborn working ethics and go back to bed, joined Eri and Lucifer on the
field. Though she felt rather uncomfortable and guilty for letting Eri made
Lucifer joining their daily work, she had to accept since it was the only way
to change her father's mind. Her guilt soon turned into disbelief when she saw
Lucifer perform the farm feast faster than any skilled farmer she knew could.
After just five hours of non-stop working, they have finished the workload for
five days. While Eri was jumping with join for having a free weekend, Isabel
was worried what such secrecy was Lucifer still hiding. The Lucifer depicted in
the bible on top of the bookshelf in Isabel's house is a vicious angel who
would stop at nothing to complete his goal. He betrayed Heaven and was now
serving his sentence as the leader of the lost soul in the underworld. She
wondered if this man really was the king of hell, what he would want from them.
Her thought was soon replaced with her wariness for her father and she rushed
back home, leaving the Eri and Lucifer back at the field. </p>

<p >Just as when Lucifer and Eri was heading back, Lucifer
started to notice Eri starting to behave strangely. She was clumsily fumble
around and walked in an unsteadily fashion. This reminded Lucifer of the first
time he met Eri, as she was also touching other furniture before she reached
the bed. He advanced toward Eri and hold her hand and waited for her reaction.
Eri looked toward Lucifer hand and then to the general direction that Lucifer's
body was at. Much to Lucifer's surprise, Eri's iris pupil was altered with a
dull white hue, making her eyes more lackluster than ever. She noded at him
with a smile, but Lucifer can sense a weight in her heart. </p>

<p >Lucifer led Eri home and guide her down at the chair. As he
looked at her again, he noticed that Eri's eye color has returned to its original
form. She looked around as if she was checking if her vision was still working
and let out a reassuring sigh. Her eyes meet a puzzling Lucifer. Although he
didn't say anything, Eri understood what Lucifer was worried about and relief
his restlessness with a shaking gesture of denial. She put a big careless grind
on her face to further show that she was alright. Lucifer ended his concern momentarily
despite that he still preferred his questions answered. As Isabel walked, she
immediately understood the problem. When Isabel was about to utter out
something, Eri gave her a furtive glance. Recognized that her friend didn't
want her secret to be out, Isabel refrained her sentences. Lucifer's curiosity
also slowly died down as the sky grew darker.</p>

<p >A week later, the sign of winter was already too conspicuous
as the snow was falling heavily on the field. The biting zephyr twisted and
crept through the small cracks in the thin wooden wall, darken the room with a
faint shade of blue. Eri and Lucifer was enjoying her week off around the
candles due to that they have finished the work for a month ahead at this point.
They were sitting at the table chatting while drinking warm ginger juice
together. By chatting, it is just Eri spewing nonstop about her favorite food.
This have become a routine for them since Eri didn't have much else to do since
it was too cold outside. Although Lucifer's glimpse was as sharp as always, his
ear was still following every word Eri said. Deep inside, there is a strange
force that keep him wanting to know more about this eccentric girl. Lucifer
wondered if there are any more interesting characters in this world that could
make him as curious as her. As Eri passionately continuing, she didn't realize
that the candles between them was also fueled more stably and strongly as time
went by.</p>

<p >Suddenly, Isabel opened the door forcefully. She stopped for
a second to catch her breath as she gasped intensely. The frost and snow from
outside quickly flow into the house. The squall was so strong and gelid that
the strong fire of the candles had no choice but gave in. Haven't even finish
their astonishment from Isabel's unexpected visit, they were already bombarded
by the bitter air. Eri while still shivering, asked:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span> "What's wrong Isabel? You can come in and we can tal..."</p>

<p >Isabel quickly refused her offer and shout hastily; her
words are stammered with outburst emotion:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My father!!! My father.... h....he coughed!!! Blood!! Blood is... everywhere!!</p>

<p>Her eyes and cheek were filled with rolling tears. The steam
of agony and exhaustion wrapped around her body, created an invisible forced
that protected her fragile feeling and hope against the dreadful weather. Eri
immediately stood up with shook from the news she just received. She then returned
to her sense and together with Lucifer and Isabel quickly ran back to Isabel's
house. </p>

<p>The wind got stronger each minute, carrying a bundle of snow
and sorrow with it to every corner of the towns. At Isabel's house, Isabel, Eri
and Lucifer were sitting silently around the old squeaky bed that Uncle Huddle was
resting in. The dim fire from the hearth slowly letting out heat, little by
little, to compensate the heavy feeling that covered the room.</p>

<p >Huddle's face was pale white. His usual cheerful appearance
was replaced with anguish and endurance. He panted quickly to get more air in
and prepared to endure another wave of pain sneaking through all corner of his
muscles. He was tired, or had been tired, with fighting with this demonic pain
for years. His left hand suddenly grabbed his chest as his back convulsed
upward. Isabel lowered her head while Eri looked to Lucifer who was sitting
beside her, as they couldn't bear watching their energetic man suffer. Unable
to do anything else, Isabel quickly reached out and held Huddle's other hand
tightly to her forehead, wishing from the bottom of her heart that she could
share this pain with him. The coldness of his hand perturbed her line of
thoughts, making her horrific imagination ran wild. Trying to not overthink
about the future, she bit her lower lips as hard as she could and contained her
hiccups, waiting for the unknown to come with the slim fire.</p>

<p >Another round of coughing was heard loud and clear in the
middle of the soundless night. Huddle's hand which was holding is mouth was
then painted red. Eri shivered from the sight and turn her head again toward
Lucifer direction as reflex. Huddle felt a little more at ease, but he knew
this moment of lightness could be his last. Muster his remaining strength, he
turned around and looked at the girls who were silently weeping dry. His eyes
then met Lucifer's. He had not known Lucifer for long and also had not made
much interaction with him, yet, he sensed a something within Lucifer. He knew
from the first day he met Lucifer about a strong abhorrence in his heart and a
strong determination in his eyes. He could saw the internal struggle against
the impossible behind the flesh and bandage and that courage somehow
transferred to him.</p>

<p >Without wanting to delay any further, he slid his hand which
was held by Isabel over to her head and gently stroke her hair. As Isabel
sacredly looked up, she saw her father flashed a big pained smile; sweat was
still running down his cheek. He opened his mouth. His speech was as clear and
bold as ever:</p>

<p CxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Isabel,... don't forget to water the potatoes...after sweeping the snow
tomorrow."</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Don't say anymore, father! Focus... focus your strength on ..."-Isabel said
trying to keep her calm, but her tears were about to roll out any second.</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Just hear me...The potatoes haven't been watered long enough...You needed
to water it..."</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Or else, how are you gonna pay for my funeral, my dear?"-Continued
Huddle, with a prankful grind.</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"This is no time to joke around father!! You can still l..."</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"I know myself, dear! Take care of the farm when I'm gone, ok?"</p>

<p CxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"FATHER!!"-cried Isabel, as she broke down at the bed side.</p>

<p >This was the first time Eri saw the desperation in Huddle's
word. From the day she lived with him, he was her main reason that keep her
alive. She looked up to him not only for his over the top cheerfulness and
kindness but also his will to continue his battle to this very day. A she saw
him in such state, Eri realized that what he gave her was even greater than
what she had ever imagined.</p>

<p CxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Don't worry, uncle Huddle!! I will go get the doctor. The potatoes can
be harvest soon so I will just ask him to waver the payment for later."- said
Eri with confidence. She then stood up and ran toward the door.</p>

<p CxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"No...!! Stop, Eri!! You can't go out at this weather!! Your eyes... your
eyes..."</p>

<p >As Isabel tried to stop her friend, Huddle sat up and jumped
in the conversation:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"She's right Eri!! Don't go! And it's not like any doctor will want to
come at this wheathe..."</p>

<p >Couldn't finished his sentences, Huddle let out another
round of cough. The blanket and his hands were stained with small blood
puddles. As Isabel lowered her father's head back to the pillow, Eri felt more
determined to continue with what she said. Her legs continue to move forwards
without any control from her brain. Before passing the door, Isabel called up
to her:</p>

<p CxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"If that's the case, let me go! I will get the doctor!"</p>

<p CxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"No! You need to spend more time with your father for now. I will go!"</p>

<p >She said as she sprinted out of the house and left the door
opened. Another swarm of cold air poured in as Huddle continued gasping in
pain. Lucifer quickly stood up and closed the door. His thought was now as
dispersed as everyone, but it was due to the interest caused by Eri's radical
behaviors.</p>

<p >In contrast to the more calmly head of Lucifer, Isabel's
mind was now in a deep abyss. She couldn't control her feeling anymore and
resolved into a blank expression as tear kept running down her cheek. She
continued to look at the direction that Eri shadow was disappearing in the
thick snow and left kept her lips unclosed. Another soft coughed of Huddle
brought Isabel back to her sense. She intended to turn back to the direction of
the cough, but at mid-way, her eyes met Lucifer's. Lucifer eye brows started to
raise up, as his iris changed from black to bright red. His eyes started to
glow softly, but this miracle was not caught by Isabel. She returned with what
she was doing and grabbed her father's hand. She put her head on her father's
forehead to check his temperature, but the result didn't bring her any
satisfaction. In the trance of bad event, she started speaking in soliloquy. </p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"You mustn't go out Eri! You will go blind if you exceed your stamina
without a rest! Please return...Please return..."</p>

<p >As she monologued, she sensed faint, white smoke streaming
through her feet. As she traced to a direction where the smoked was, she saw
nothing of unusual and the smoke soon subdued. Overwhelmed by her feeling, she
didn't notice there were only two people in the room left when she returned to
her father's side.</p>

<p >The tormented darkness of the sky coated a damped and
haunted feeling to the profuse layers of snow. The moon was shedding its light
in a futile attempt to protect the wandering soul from the night's danger, but
the light reflection of the snow only made the scenery more skewedly spectral.
Eri was running regardless of the atmosphere around her. Her will fire was
strong enough to make her more daring; as she stepped through the mellow snow
with forces. </p>

<p >After Eri ran for a while, orange lights started to appear
in the distance, emitting a safe feeling for travelers at the most needed time.
Eri heart raced, as she was not too far from her destination anymore. Never was
a woman of faith, Eri found herself praying as she ran. She prayed that a
miracle would come, that another of her father-figure would be cured, and that
she would have enough strength to find a doctor in time. She prayed that fate
would be mercy on Uncle Huddle, but, had fate ever been mercy to anyone?</p>

<p >The town where the street lamps illuminated the night was
also covered in heavy snow. The street were empty, for everyone had been
informed of the upcoming snow storm. Through the gap between the planks of the
windows, the smell of cuisines and butter spread over the town and smeared over
each flake of the falling snow, making one would not hesitate to take a spoon
and dig into the fat white pile in front of their door. Eri kept running until
she reached a big brick house with multiple windows. She banged on the door and
yell loudly. A middle age man holding a candle plate opened the door
unpleasantly. Eri quickly screamed out her thoughts before the man could say
anything:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Doctor Anthy, please help!! My uncle is coughing blood! He is in great
pain! We must hurry and get..."</p>

<p >Before Eri could finished her sentence, the man who was
called Anthy quickly raised his hand to her face to express his disapproval and
denied her request:</p>

<p CxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"I'm sorry Eri! The snow storm is worsened! I don't think it's safe for me
or you to travel to during this time!! Why don't you come i..."</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"No! Doctor Anthy, you must go with me! Uncle Huddle doesn't have much
time left!!"-Interrupted Eri, her tone soon become like that of a kid who
didn't get what he wants.</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"I'm sorry Eri. I really don't want to risk going out tonight. If the
snow stopped, I would quickly come by tomorrow..."</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Tomorrow?! We don't have that much time!! Please, I begged you, doctor!
Please go with me tonight!"</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"As I said Eri, I can't go tonight! I am really sorry! You should go any
further either!</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Please, doctor, I begged you!</p>

<p CxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"I'm really sorry, Eri!"</p>

<p >He closed the door as he finished his words. Eri stepped
back, a sense of anger, sorrow and impotent swamped her as she tried to pound
the door in vain. After the futile attempt, she quickly calmed her mind with a
deep breath and ran to the next doctor's house. The doctor's wife peeked at Eri
as she ran away in pity while Anthy sigh softly and looked at the cold chicken
drum on his plate.</p>

<p >Eri continued to knock on more doctors' house, but she
received a similarly cold treatment or worse from each of them. At the fifth
doctor, not only he chased Eri away but throwing his furniture at her. One of
the pan threw hit Eri lightly in the head, but this was enough to bring her
hands to the floor. The door was slammed acrimoniously behind her, as she tried
to get up. She lift her hand to touch bruise on her head, and continued
navigating the road with the object around her. From the moment she met doctor
Anthy, her vision had become blurrier than ever and even without the pan
hitting her, it is just a matter of minutes before she can only see darkness. A
miscalculation between objects distance due to her hastiness brought her to the
cold snowy pedway again. Her legs muscles started to contract violently due to
constant running. She held her legs while panting in quick pace. The steam
coming out of her lungs blended in with the creamy snow, making it bitter than
ever. She continued crawled forward with her other frigid hand and let her legs
slid along. </p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Must... keep...going..."</p>

<p >As her hand reached its limit, she collapsed into the white
ground. Snow started to cover her entire body while she wiggled every
responding muscle to get up. Before becoming finally sightless, she noticed a
faint range of bring yellow as if it was the sun. She then felt her body moved
upward as one of her hand was squeezed tightly. </p>

<p >Lucifer looked at Eri's pallid face for seconds. Their eyes
met as Eri turned her head toward the light source. As if she understood
Lucifer's question despite Lucifer haven't utter a word, Eri muttered. Her eyes
were blank white, but they were <span style='font-size:9.5pt;line-height:107%'>brighter
than anyt</span>hing Lucifer has ever seen:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Don't...want to...live...when...haven't...tried...every...thi..."</p>

<p >Her consciousness has already subdued to the numbness as she
spoke. Lucifer continued to look at Eri for a while then walked toward the next
doctor's house with Eri on his back. Below his concealed face was a smile of
satisfaction. The dark flame of hatred in his heart was now faded into gold. He
let out a long stream of fog as he enjoyed the intriguing wintry night. As he
walked and humming a tune, he remembered the past few days spending with Eri
and what was so called "the truth about human" impregnated in his heart by his
father. By defending for mankind, he was chased of heaven in the most
humiliating way possible, but he couldn't be happier now that such punishment
was given to him. He reached the next doctor's house while his thought was
still all over the place. He felt lucky to have cross path with Eri, but now he
had to pave his own destiny. Made up his mind, he knocked on the door. The
sounds of his flimsy hand clashing with cold hard wood spread deeply to the
surrounding, announcing the new era of doom is about to start.</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Thank you...Eri...but before that...one last test...."</p>

<p >Eri woke up as she lay on a soft spongy sheet. Although her
eyes were fully open, she could only see darkness. She understood her current
state and started moving her hand around to look for any object that could help
her get up. She heard Isabel's joyful voice approaching her:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Oh! You are awake! I was so worried! Don't do something so reckless
again!"</p>

<p >Isabel then lifted Eri back up and held her friend's hand.
She handed her a cup of warm cocoa.</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Here, drink this! This will warm you up."</p>

<p >Eri took a sip. Her mind started to go frantic against as
the abundant energy from the cocoa was quickly absorbed. She traced around
Isabel's hand and grabbed Isabel by her shoulder, asking how she returned to
Isabel's house and what happened to Uncle Huddle. Isabel was surprised, as
Huddle was right behind her since she entered the room. Huddle was standing
vitally, as his face was rather florid, and his arm was so much muscular than
when he was sick. Isabel waved her hands around her friend's eyes. Eri's
irresponsiveness have proved Isabel's bad assumption. She held Eri's head to
her chest, as tear slowly flooding out of her canthi. </p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"I'm sorry....Eri! I'm sorry!!"</p>

<p >Feeling the warmness of Isabel pressing against her head,
Eri felt somewhat calmer. Tears started to roll down Eri's face as well before
she noticed, despite she didn't feel like here was any reason for her to cry.
Isabel sobbed for a while and started recalling to Eri about what happened
after Eri ran away that night.</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"A few hours passed after you were gone, my heart was pressed down by
the thought of losing both you and my father! Yet, as I was about to fall
asleep from exhaustion, a miracle happens."</p>

<p >She continued as her mood was slightly changed for the
better.</p>

<p CxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"You have found a doctor that was willing to travel on such weather!!
When I saw him carrying you unconsciously on his back, I was very astonished! After
he gave you to me, he quickly came to my father for a checkup and gave in an
antidote that put him to sleep painlessly and..."</p>

<p CxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"...and when I wake up after a few days, I am stronger than ever."-laughed
Huddle, as he joined in the conversation.</p>

<p >Hearing the voice of the man again, Eri was overflowed with
joy. However, fatigue only allowed her to put on a weak smile. She was glad
that her trip was not a waste after all.</p>

<p CxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"...he can even join the field work with me for two days now. Can you
believe that?" Isabel giggled, as flower of joy bloomed continuously on her
face. </p>

<p CxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"After he gave my father the medicine, that doctor quickly stood up and
seemed to be very hurry to go back. I told him that the storm was too strong at
this point and he should stayed back but he insisted on departing. I asked him
about the payment, but he said your courage had satisfied his need and left."</p>

<p >It took a while for Eri to intake all the information. At
the same time, she didn't notice any presence of Lucifer in the room or the
story back then anymore. </p>

<p CxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"What about Lucifer? Where is Lucifer? Is he here?"-Eri asked.</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Luci...who? The devil from the bible? Why are you asking about
him?"-Isabel puzzled.</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Lucifer!! Don't you remember? He has been staying with us for a few
days."</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"The devil? No! It can't be! There were only you, me and father around.
As always!"</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"No! Don't you remember? I brought a wounded guy back from Hazu forest a
while ago! Remember? He was all covered with bandage and speak like:
'Hmm...hmm...'". -Eri spoke as she moved her hands around her head and body to
imitate the rolling of bandage.</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Your fever has got quite bad. Rest for a few days more."-Said Isabel as
she lowered Eri back back to the sheet and rolled the blanket to Eri's neck.</p>

<p CxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"I will wake you up at dinner." -Said Isabel as she and Huddle walked
away from the room.</p>

<p >Eri wanted to stay up and chat more but the sleepiness soon
returned to her and she slept soundly until the stars can be clearly saw from
her windows. Satisfaction, grief and confusion slowly sneaked into her mind as
she slept and lingered there for a few more days to come.</p>

<p >The winter snow was soon washed away with the green grass of
spring. As flowers bloomed, a colorful festival of Fogine town was also under
preparation. People were flooding the street, as the joy of the warm season was
contagious. Even from miles away, in a secluded small farm, Eri could hear
vague cheers. She was sewing some clothes with her fingers bound by layers of
bandages. Against Isabel and Huddle's objection, Eri felt the need to
participate in the household's economic despite her blindness. Although it was
difficult at first, Eri soon adapted to her disadvantage and returned to her
usual self. She couldn't find out more about the disappearance of Lucifer as no
one seemed to remember anything about him, so she packed up her memory to
prepare for the new exciting day awaits her ahead.</p>

<p >The smell of freshly blossom primrose secretly entered Eri's
room and tickled her small, pert nose. She started whistling quietly as she
enjoyed the spring breeze that came in together with the glower fragrant. The
gentle sun ray melted quickly through Eri's youthful skin through the window,
making her nostalgically remember the days she could stare deep into the sun
until her eyes were all dried up. The room was glazed with such peacefulness
and serenity that a mis-beat of the heart was thought to be impossible. </p>

<p >Suddenly, Eri stood up. A strong unexpected desire to go
toward the river bank near Hazu forest started to spark inside her as if it was
talking directly to her heart. She started walking by touching the objects
around the house and then quickly increase her speed. When she arrived at the
front door, she started running frantically. Her eyes could still only see a
deep darkness, but her feet won't stop moving to a location on her mind. </p>

<p >As her feet touch a body of water, she clang to her knee and
gasp immensely.  Before she could adjust her breath, she felt two hands reached
out and covered her eyes. Caught by surprised, she felt petrified for a few
seconds and closed her eyes for some last-minute protection. From behind her, a
man's voice could be heard. His tone was flat but modulated:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Don't worry! I have a gift for you..."</p>

<p >The unknown man then withdrew his hand. Eri opened her eyes
again and much to her disbelief, colors of the scenery started to assemble
right in front of her eyes until a crispy, clear image was formed. Her brain
freed again from such amazement, and her astonishing mouth started to form a
smile as she dropped down to her knee. She pinched herself in the cheek hard. A
strong soreness ran around her face to prove that what she saw was not just a
dream. The pain was great enough that her eyes were overflow with droplet of
joy. She quickly wiped her eyes with her sleeve and look back at the source of
this miracle, only to find herself petrified once again.</p>

<p >In front of her now was a two stories tall hideous reddish
humanoid creature. Its face was extremely distorted as if it was pulled out
from the devil's nightmare itself. His wings was bat-like and his tail was
ox-like. As Eri looked into its bobbly yellowish eyes, she felt the infinite
torment of thousands of screeching souls trapped in an infinitesimal cage. His
hand was holding a red glowing metal trident, which was burnt for centuries
from the heat of wars. Eri started to sweat uncontrollably, but after a while
she managed to overcome her fear. The creature addressed itself:</p>

<p CxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Hello Eri! I am the king of Hell,..."</p>

<p CxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Lucifer... Am I right?"-Eri bravely interrupted the creature, despite
still being drunk from the horrific experience. </p>

<p >The demon looked at her with a smile. Its body started
morphing into smaller built body. A dark hair winged man appeared after the
transformation was completed. The glowing trident in his hand started to bend
itself into a rounder and thinner shaper until a halo can be see hovering above
his head. Eri glared at the magical process with excitement. The man started to
talk with no hesitation:</p>

<p CxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"I'm sorry for leaving without any notice! There are some businesses I
have to take care of."</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Are you....really Lucifer?" -Eri continued her doubt.</p>

<p CxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"You want to see me cover in bandage again, Eri?!" -Lucifer smiled.</p>

<p > Eri jumped out of the water and wrapped her arms around
Lucifer's neck. Lucifer was taken aback for a second, but knowing Eri and her
unexpected actions, he received her emotion and hugged her back tightly. </p>

<p >Then continued their conversation as they strolled around
the river bank. Eri was extremely fascinated about everything Lucifer said.
From why he was expelled from heaven to how he raised his underworld army and
became the king of Hell during the past few months, Eri was on all ears. 
Lucifer noted that a war that would shake the world would come soon and asked
that Eri didn't tell anyone about this encounter. As they reached the forest
where Lucifer was first found by Eri, Lucifer asked:</p>

<p CxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"If that man, Huddle, died now? What would you do?"</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Did I attempted to change the situation before that?"</p>

<p CxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Assume you did."</p>

<p >Without a second of second thought, Eri answered:</p>

<p CxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"I would have wept and cried my heart out for him. Then I will recover
and wake up the next day with a smile on my face."</p>

<p CxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Then why are you trying so hard back then? What's the difference
between him dying then and now?"</p>

<p CxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"NO! The difference is not now and then! It's about have you tried your
best. If it's for your love ones' sake, a little sacrifice should never be too
much, isn't it?</p>

<p >The curiosity and desire to test Eri in Lucifer had vanished
without a trace. The smile of Eri after her last answer gave Lucifer a full
round of satisfaction as he laughed loudly with her. Lucifer pulled out from
his tunic a golden apple and asked Eri to keep it with her at all time. </p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"The war is unavoidable, but if you are the one who initiate it, I
believed you can end it!"</p>

<p >Before parting their way, Lucifer expressed his gratitude
toward Eri:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Thank you, Eri! You have salvaged me from the moment I doubt myself.
Samuel's apple was not meant to be consumed as it would only bring you torment
and despair; but if you just carried it with you, good luck will certainly come
for you."</p>

<p >As he finished his advice and turned away to open a portal
from mid-air, Eri shouted out:</p>

<p  style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"I prefer that fire and horn, you know! It really screams out King of
Hell to me!!"</p>

<p >Looked back at Eri with astonishment, Lucifer laughed loudly
as he transformed himself back to his demonic form. He then looked at Eri again,
who was now accustomed to his grotesque appearance and smiled back. His eyes were
blazing yellow and sparked the lights of hope. Out of a whim and his love for
her, he roared:</p>

<p CxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Promise you would outlive me this time! Human!"</p>

<p CxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"That I can't do! You know, when my loved one need me, I... ah, you know
the rest, don't you?"</p>

<p >Said Eri, as she pretending to blush. Lucifer cackled
uncontrollably at the weird sight as he was submerged by a wall of fire.</p>

<p >Eri stood there for a while. Everything just happened within
a few hours back was too strong for a person who act on her heart to intake at
once. She sat down and looked into the distance. She started to feel her eyes
heavier as she rested her head on her knee. The wind ambled wildly, carrying
leaves and dust around the cloudy sky. Eri kneaded her eyes as rolls of tear
had slither down her face since God know when. She twirl her hazelnut hair as
she looked at it; and accidently pull out a strand. The pain returned her to
her sense, as she stood up and dust the back of her dress. She mumbled:" Thank
you Lucifer..." and walked home intending to get Isabel to teach her more about
the bible on the shelves.</p>
